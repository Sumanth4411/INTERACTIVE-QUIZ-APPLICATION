#DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK: The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based application designed to provide users with an engaging and dynamic quiz experience. It is built using a combination of core web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to deliver an interactive and responsive user interface. The application allows users to take a quiz by answering multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback on their answers, along with a real-time score calculation. The primary goal of this project was to create an intuitive, engaging, and mobile-friendly web application that would be both fun and educational.
The development process starts with HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which serves as the foundation for the structure of the application. HTML provides the necessary elements like headings, buttons, form inputs, and containers to display questions, answers, and scores. The content of the application is organized in a clean, semantic structure to make it easily understandable for both users and developers. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is then used to style the application, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate. The color palette is carefully selected to ensure a pleasant user experience, with blue tones used for interactive elements like buttons and scores, and softer backgrounds to reduce visual strain. Additionally, CSS Flexbox is utilized to create responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring the quiz remains accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
